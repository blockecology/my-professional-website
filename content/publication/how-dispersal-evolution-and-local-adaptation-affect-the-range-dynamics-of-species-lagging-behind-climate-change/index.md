  As climate changes, species' ability to spatially track suitable climate
  depends on their spread velocity, a function of their population growth and
  dispersal capacity. When climate changes faster than species can spread, the
  climate experienced at species' expanding range edges may ameliorate as
  conditions become increasingly similar to those of the range core. When this
  boosts species' growth rates, their spread accelerates. Here, we use
  simulations of a spreading population with an annual life history to explore
  how climatic amelioration interacts with dispersal evolution and local
  adaptation to determine the dynamics of spread. We found that depending on the
  timing of dispersal evolution, spread velocity can show contrasting
  trajectories, sometimes transiently exceeding the climate velocity before
  decelerating. Climatic amelioration can also accelerate the spread of
  populations composed of genotypes best adapted to local climatic conditions,
  but the exact dynamics depends on the pattern of climatic adaptation. We
  conclude that failing to account for demographic variation across climatic
  gradients can lead to erroneous conclusions about species' capacity to
  spatially track suitable climate.
