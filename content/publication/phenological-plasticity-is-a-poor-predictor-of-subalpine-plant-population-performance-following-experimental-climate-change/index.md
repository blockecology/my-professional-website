abstract: Phenological shifts, changes in the seasonal timing of life cycle
  events, are among the best documented responses of species to climate change.
  However, the consequences of these phenological shifts for population dynamics
  remain unclear. Population growth could be enhanced if species that advance
  their phenology benefit from longer growing seasons and gain a pre-emptive
  advantage in resource competition. However, it might also be reduced if
  phenological advances increase exposure to stresses, such as herbivores and,
  in colder climates, harsh abiotic conditions early in the growing season. We
  exposed subalpine grasslands to ~3 K of warming by transplanting intact turfs
  from 2000 m to 1400 m elevation in the eastern Swiss Alps, with turfs
  transplanted within the 2000 m site acting as a control. In the first growing
  season after transplantation, we recorded species’ flowering phenology at both
  elevations. We also measured species’ cover change for three consecutive years
  as a measure of plant performance. We used models to estimate species’
  phenological plasticity (the response of flowering time to the change in
  climate) and analysed its relationship with cover changes following climate
  change. The phenological plasticity of the 18 species in our study varied
  widely but was unrelated to their changes in cover. Moreover, early- and
  late-flowering species did not differ in their cover response to warming, nor
  in the relationship between cover changes and phenological plasticity. These
  results were replicated in a similar transplant experiment within the same
  subalpine community, established one year earlier and using larger turfs. We
  discuss the various ecological processes that can be affected by phenological
  shifts, and argue why the population-level consequences of these shifts are
  likely to be species- and context-specific. Our results highlight the
  importance of testing assumptions about how warming-induced changes in
  phenotypic traits, like phenology, impact population dynamics.
