abstract: >
  Forecasting the trajectories of species assemblages in response to ongoing
  climate change requires quantifying the time lags in the demographic and
  ecological processes through which climate impacts species' abundances. Since
  experimental climate manipulations are typically abrupt, the observed species
  responses may not match their responses to gradual climate change. We
  addressed this problem by transplanting alpine grassland turfs to lower
  elevations, recording species' demographic responses to climate and
  competition, and using these data to parameterise community dynamics models
  forced by scenarios of gradual climate change. We found that shifts in
  community structure following an abrupt climate manipulation were not simply
  accelerated versions of shifts expected under gradual warming, as the former
  missed the transient rise of species benefiting from moderate warming. Time
  lags in demography and species interactions controlled the pace and trajectory
  of changing species' abundances under simulated 21st-century climate change,
  and thereby prevented immediate diversity loss.
