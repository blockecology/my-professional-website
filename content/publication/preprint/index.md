title: Lowland plant arrival in alpine ecosystems facilitates a decrease in soil
  carbon content under experimental climate warming
abstract: Climate warming is releasing carbon from soils around the world,
  constituting a positive climate feedback. Warming is also causing species to
  expand their ranges into new ecosystems. Yet, in most ecosystems, whether
  range expanding species will amplify or buffer expected soil carbon loss is
  unknown. Here, we used two whole-community transplant experiments and a
  follow-up glasshouse experiment to determine whether the establishment of
  herbaceous lowland plants in alpine ecosystems influences soil carbon content
  under warming. We found that warming (transplantation to low elevation) led to
  a negligible decrease in alpine soil carbon content, but its effects became
  significant and 52% ± 31% (mean ± 95% confidence intervals) larger after
  lowland plants were introduced at low density into the ecosystem. We present
  evidence that decreases in soil carbon content likely occurred via lowland
  plants increasing rates of root exudation, soil microbial respiration, and CO2
  release under warming. Our findings suggest that warming-induced range
  expansions of herbaceous plants have the potential to alter climate feedbacks
  from this system, and that plant range expansions among herbaceous communities
  may be an overlooked mediator of warming effects on carbon dynamics.
