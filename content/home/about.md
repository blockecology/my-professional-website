I am a sustainability consultant specialized on climate change and biodiversity protection. I use a range of data-driven analytic and modelling approaches to quantify sustainability issues, from biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation to climate change emissions and air pollution. I derive insights from data to help guide environmental policy and maximize the performance of sustainability investments.
